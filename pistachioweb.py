st.write("""
This app capable on making **classification** on Pistachio images by feeding the various types of Pistachio images into a deep learning model named VGG116.\n
VGG16 is a convolutional neural network with 16 layers deep and the model used transfer learning where the model has been pre-trained through more than a million images from ImageNet database.\n

st.write('''
We can see that both Pistachios' look very similar though some of them has distinct features though it can be difficult to recognize from naked eye.
Now we will be using an Artificial Intelligence to reach conclusion where it could make prediction between Kirmizi and Siirt Pistachio.

Before splitting the image dataset into 80% training and 20% testing, the datasets undergoes data augmentation 
The datasets then split into 80% for training and 20% for testing phase.
