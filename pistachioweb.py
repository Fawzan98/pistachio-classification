st.title('Pistachio Classification Prediction App')
st.header('Introduction')
st.write("""
This app capable on making **classification** on Pistachio images by feeding the various types of Pistachio images into a deep learning model named VGG116.\n
VGG16 is a convolutional neural network with 16 layers deep and the model used transfer learning where the model has been pre-trained through more than a million images from ImageNet database.\n
Coding source inspiration : [Pistachio Detection by Ayush Verma](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ayushv322/pistachio-detection-vgg16-97-9)

The datasets were obtained in Kaggle which contain a total of 2148 images, 1232 of Kirmizi and 916 of Siirt Pistachio.\n

st.write('''
We can see that both Pistachios' look very similar though some of them has distinct features though it can be difficult to recognize from naked eye.
Now we will be using an Artificial Intelligence to reach conclusion where it could learn to make predictions between Kirmizi and Siirt Pistachio.

st.subheader('Image Augmentation')

st.write('''
A a technique of applying different transformations to original images which results in multiple transformed copies of the same image.
This technique not only expand the size of your dataset but also incorporate a level of variation in the dataset which allows your model to generalize better on unseen data. 
Also, the model becomes more robust when it is trained on new, slightly altered images.

st.write('''
Before splitting the image dataset into 80% training and 20% testing, the datasets undergoes data augmentation 
The datasets then split into 80% for training and 20% for testing phase.
